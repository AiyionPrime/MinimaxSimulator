/**
 * "In computer science, a topological sort (sometimes abbreviated topsort or toposort) or
 * topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every
 * directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the
 * vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent
 * constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological
 * ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible if and only
 * if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG)." <br>
 * <br>
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting<br>
 * <br>
 * Implementations of this class can compute a topological sorting on an arbitrary collection of
 * elements.<br>
 * For a topological sorting, there must exist a dependency relation between the elements which must
 * be supplied to the various <tt>sort</tt> methods.
