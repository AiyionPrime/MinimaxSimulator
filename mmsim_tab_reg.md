The base registers are displayed but they are not editable.

Pressing <img class="inline" src="images/btn_reg_add.png" /> adds a new register to the machine. The newly created register can be named and it is possible to add a description to it. The changes take effect after pressing <img class="inline" src="images/btn_save.png" />. Deleting a register is done by selected the register from the list and then pressing <img class="inline" src="images/btn_del.png" />.
